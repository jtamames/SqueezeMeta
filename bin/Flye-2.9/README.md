Flye assembler
==============

[![BioConda Install](https://img.shields.io/conda/dn/bioconda/flye.svg?style=flag&label=BioConda%20install)](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/flye)

### Version: 2.9

Flye is a de novo assembler for single molecule sequencing reads,
such as those produced by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
It is designed for a wide range of datasets, from small bacterial projects
to large mammalian-scale assemblies. The package represents a complete
pipeline: it takes raw PacBio / ONT reads as input and outputs polished contigs.
Flye also has a special mode for metagenome assembly.

Latest updates
--------------

### Flye 2.9 release (20 Aug 2022)
* Better assembly of very short sequences (e.g. plasmids or viruses). They vere often missed in previous versions.
* New --nano-hq mode for ONT Guppy5+ and Q20 reads (3-5% error rate)
* Optimized default parameters for HiFi (HPC error threshold 0.01 -> 0.001; increased min overlap)
* Polishing improvements: reduced number of possible clusters of errors
* Improvements in repeat delection algorithm to further limit a chance of (otherwise infrequent) misassemblies
* Scaffolding is no longer performed by default (could be enabled with --scaffold)
* Bam file input for the standalone polisher (same interface as for FASTA/Q)
* Automatically selected minimum overlap up to 10k (was 5k)
* Discontinued --plasmid option due to the improvements in short sequences assembly
* --trestle and --subassemblies modes are now deprecated, and will be removed in the future versions
* New --extra-params option to modify config-level parameters
* Contig paths output in Gfa + number of reads supporting each link (RC tag)
* Update to minimap 2.19
* Several rare bug fixes/other improvements

### Flye 2.8.3 release (10 Feb 2021)
* Reduced RAM consumption for some ultra-long ONT datasets
* Fixed rare artifical sequence insertions on some ONT datasets
* Asseemblies should be largely identical to 2.8

### Flye 2.8.2 release (12 Dec 2020)
* Improvements in GFA output, much faster generation of large and tangled graphs
* Speed improvements for graph simplification algorithms
* A few minor bugs fixed
* Assemblies should be largely identical to 2.8

### Flye 2.8.1 release (02 Sep 2020)
* Added a new option `--hifi-error` to control the expected error rate of HiFi reads (no other changes)

### Flye 2.8 release (04 Aug 2020)
* Improvements in contiguity and speed for PacBio HiFi mode
* Using the `--meta` k-mer selection strategy in isolate assemblies as well.
This strategy is more robust to drops in coverage/contamination and reqires less memory
* 1.5-2x RAM footprint reduction for large assemblies (e.g. human ONT assembly now uses 400-500 Gb)
* Genome size parameter is no longer required (it is still needed for downsampling though `--asm-coverage`)
* Flye now can occasionally use overlaps shorter than "minOverlap" parameter to close disjointig gaps
* Various improvements and bugfixes


Repeat graph
------------

Flye is using repeat graph as a core data structure. 
In difference to de Bruijn graphs (which require exact k-mer matches),
repeat graphs are built using approximate sequence matches, and
can tolerate higher noise of SMS reads.

The edges of repeat graph represent genomic sequence, and nodes define
the junctions. Each edges is classified into unique or repetitive.
The genome traverses the graph (in an unknown way), so as each unique
edge appears exactly once in this traversal. Repeat graphs reveal the
repeat structure of the genome, which helps to reconstruct an optimal assembly.

</p>

Above is an example of the repeat graph of a bacterial assembly.
Each edge is labeled with its id, length and coverage. Repetitive edges are shown
in color, and unique edges are black. Note that each edge is represented in 
two copies: forward and reverse complement (marked with +/- signs), 
therefore the entire genome is represented in two copies. This is necessary
because the orientation of input reads is unknown.

In this example, there are two unresolved repeats: (i) a red repeat of 
multiplicity two and length 35k and (ii) a green repeat cluster of multiplicity
three and length 34k - 36k. As the repeats remained unresolved, there are no reads
in the dataset that cover those repeats in full. Five unique edges 
will correspond to five contigs in the final assembly.

Repeat graphs produced by Flye could be visualized using
[AGB](https://github.com/almiheenko/AGB) or [Bandage](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage).

The assemblies generated using Flye 2.9 could be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5228989).
All datasets were run with default parameters for the corresponding read type
with the following exceptions: CHM13 T2T, CHM1 and HG002 were run with `--asm-coverage 50`.

Note that this version of the table reflects contigs NG50, while the previous versions
were refering to scaffold NG50.
