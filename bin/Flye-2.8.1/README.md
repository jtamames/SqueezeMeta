Flye assembler
==============

[![BioConda Install](https://img.shields.io/conda/dn/bioconda/flye.svg?style=flag&label=BioConda%20install)](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/flye)

### Version: 2.8.1

Flye is a de novo assembler for single molecule sequencing reads,
such as those produced by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
It is designed for a wide range of datasets, from small bacterial projects
to large mammalian-scale assemblies. The package represents a complete
pipeline: it takes raw PacBio / ONT reads as input and outputs polished contigs.
Flye also has a special mode for metagenome assembly.

Latest updates
--------------

### Flye 2.8.1 release (02 Sep 2020)
* Added a new option `--hifi-error` to control the expected error rate of HiFi reads (no other changes)

### Flye 2.8 release (04 Aug 2020)
* Improvements in contiguity and speed for PacBio HiFi mode
* Using the `--meta` k-mer selection strategy in isolate assemblies as well.
This strategy is more robust to drops in coverage/contamination and reqires less memory
* 1.5-2x RAM footprint reduction for large assemblies (e.g. human ONT assembly now uses 400-500 Gb)
* Genome size parameter is no longer required (it is still needed for downsampling though `--asm-coverage`)
* Flye now can occasionally use overlaps shorter than "minOverlap" parameter to close disjointig gaps
* Various improvements and bugfixes

### Flye 2.7.1. release (24 Apr 2020)
* Fixes very long GFA generation time for some large assemblies (no other changes)

### Flye 2.7 release (03 Mar 2020)
* Better assemblies of real (and comlpex) metagenomes
* New option to retain alternative haplotypes, rather than collapsing them (`--keep-haplotypes`)
* PacBio HiFi mode
* Using Bam instead of Sam to reduce storage requirements and IO load
* Improved human assemblies
* Annotation of alternative contigs
* Better polishing quality for the newest ONT datasets
* Trestle module is disabled by default (use `--trestle` to enable)
* Many big fixes and improvements

### Flye 2.6 release (19 Sep 2019)
* This release introduces Python 3 support (no other changes)

### Flye 2.5 release (25 Jul 2019)
* Better ONT polishing for the latest basecallers (Guppy/flipflop)
* Improved consensus quality of repetitive regions
* More contiguous assemblies of real metagenomes
* Improvements for human genome assemblies
* Various bugfixes and performance optimizations
* Also check the new [FAQ section](docs/FAQ.md)


Repeat graph
------------

Flye is using repeat graph as a core data structure. 
In difference to de Bruijn graphs (which require exact k-mer matches),
repeat graphs are built using approximate sequence matches, and
can tolerate higher noise of SMS reads.

The edges of repeat graph represent genomic sequence, and nodes define
the junctions. Each edges is classified into unique or repetitive.
The genome traverses the graph (in an unknown way), so as each unique
edge appears exactly once in this traversal. Repeat graphs reveal the
repeat structure of the genome, which helps to reconstruct an optimal assembly.

Above is an example of the repeat graph of a bacterial assembly.
Each edge is labeled with its id, length and coverage. Repetitive edges are shown
in color, and unique edges are black. Note that each edge is represented in 
two copies: forward and reverse complement (marked with +/- signs), 
therefore the entire genome is represented in two copies. This is necessary
because the orientation of input reads is unknown.

In this example, there are two unresolved repeats: (i) a red repeat of 
multiplicity two and length 35k and (ii) a green repeat cluster of multiplicity
three and length 34k - 36k. As the repeats remained unresolved, there are no reads
in the dataset that cover those repeats in full. Five unique edges 
will correspond to five contigs in the final assembly.

Repeat graphs produced by Flye could be visualized using
[AGB](https://github.com/almiheenko/AGB) or [Bandage](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage).

The assemblies generated using Flye 2.8 could be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3965035).
All datasets were run with default parameters for the corresponding read type
with the following exceptions: CHM13 T2T was run with `--min-overlap 10000 --asm-coverage 50`;
CHM1 was run with `--asm-coverage 50`. CHM13 HiFi and HG002 HiFi datasets were run in
`--pacbio-hifi` mode and `--hifi-error 0.003`.
