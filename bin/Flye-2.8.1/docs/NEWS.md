Flye 2.8.1 release (02 Sep 2020)
===============================
* Added a new option `--hifi-error` to control the expected error rate of HiFi reads (no other changes)

Flye 2.8 release (04 Aug 2020)
==============================
* Improvements in contiguity and speed for PacBio HiFi mode
* Using the `--meta` k-mer selection strategy in isolate assemblies as well.
This strategy is more robust to drops in coverage/contamination and reqires less memory
* 1.5-2x RAM footprint reduction for large assemblies (e.g. human ONT assembly now uses 400-500 Gb)
* Genome size parameter is no longer required (it is still needed for downsampling though `--asm-coverage`)
* Flye now can occasionally use overlaps shorter than "minOverlap" parameter to close disjointig gaps
* Various improvements and bugfixes

Flye 2.7.1. release (24 Apr 2020)
=================================
* Fixes very long GFA generation time for some large assemblies (no other changes)

Flye 2.7 release (03 Mar 2020)
==============================
* Better assemblies of real (and comlpex) metagenomes
* New option to retain alternative haplotypes, rather than collapsing them (`--keep-haplotypes`)
* PacBio HiFi mode
* Using Bam instead of Sam to reduce storage requirements and IO load
* Improved human assemblies
* Annotation of alternative contigs
* Better polishing quality for the newest ONT datasets
* Trestle module is disabled by default (use `--trestle` to enable)
* Many big fixes and improvements

Flye 2.6 release (19 Sep 2019)
==============================
* This release introduces Python 3 support (no other changes)

Flye 2.5 release (25 Jul 2019)
==============================
* Better ONT polishing for the latest basecallers (Guppy/flipflop)
* Improved consensus quality of repetitive regions
* More contiguous assemblies of real metagenomes
* Improvements for human genome assemblies
* Various bugfixes and performance optimizations

Flye 2.4.2 release (06 Apr 2019)
================================
* Improvements in k-mer selection and tip clipping for metagenome assemblies
* Better memory managment during consensus/polishing
* Some bugfixes

Flye 2.4.1 release (05 Mar 2019)
================================
* Speed and stability improvements for large datasets
* New option `--polish-target` to run Flye polisher on the target sequence


Flye 2.4 release (14 Jan 2019)
==============================
* Metagenome assembly support fully integrated (`--meta` option)
* New Trestle module for resolving simple unbridged repeats
* New `--plasmids` option that recovers short unassembled plasmids

Flye 2.3.7 (14 Nov 2018)
=======================
* Improvements in repeat edges detection
* More precise read mapping - more contiguous assemblies for some datasets
* Memory and performance optimizations for high-coverage datasets
* More accurate repeat graphs for complex datasets


Flye 2.3.6 (24 Sep 2018)
========================
* Memory consumption for large genome assemblies reduced by ~30%
* It could be reduced even further by using the new option --asm-coverage,
which specifies a subset of reads for initial contig assembly
* Better repeat graph representation for complex genomes
* Various bugfixes and stability improvements

Flye 2.3.5 (7 August 2018)
==========================
* New solid kmer alignment implementation with improved specificity
* Better corrected reads support
* Minimum overlap is now selected within a wider range for better support of datasets with shorter read length
* Assembly of large (human size) genomes is now faster
* Various bugfixes and stability improvements

Flye 2.3.4 (19 May 2018)
========================
* A fix for assemblies with low reads count
* Polishing of large genomes is now 2-3x faster and requires less memory

Flye 2.3.3 (27 Mar 2018)
========================
* Automatic selection of minimum overlap parameter based on read length
* Improvements in large genome assemblies
* Minimap2 updated
* Other bugfixes

Flye 2.3.2 (19 Feb 2018)
========================
* Better contiguity for larger genome assemblies
* Improvements in corrected reads mode
* Various bugfixes

Flye 2.3.1 (13 Jan 2018)
