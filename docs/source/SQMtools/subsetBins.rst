   +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
   | ``SQM``                          | SQM object to be subsetted.      |
   +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
   | ``bins``                         | character. Vector of bins to be  |
   |                                  | selected.                        |
   +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
   | ``trusted_functions_only``       | logical. If ``TRUE``, only       |
   |                                  | highly trusted functional        |
   |                                  | annotations (best hit + best     |
   |                                  | average) will be considered when |
   |                                  | generating aggregated function   |
   |                                  | tables. If ``FALSE``, best hit   |
   |                                  | annotations will be used         |
   |                                  | (default ``FALSE``).             |
   +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
   | `                                | logical. If ``FALSE``, ORFs with |
   | `ignore_unclassified_functions`` | no functional classification     |
   |                                  | will be aggregated together into |
   |                                  | an "Unclassified" category. If   |
   |                                  | ``TRUE``, they will be ignored   |
   |                                  | (default ``FALSE``).             |
   +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
   | ``rescale_tpm``                  | logical. If ``TRUE``, TPMs for   |
   |                                  | KEGGs, COGs, and PFAMs will be   |
   |                                  | recalculated (so that the TPMs   |
   |                                  | in the subset actually add up to |
   |                                  | 1 million). Otherwise,           |
   |                                  | per-function TPMs will be        |
   |                                  | calculated by aggregating the    |
   |                                  | TPMs of the ORFs annotated with  |
   |                                  | that function, and will thus     |
   |                                  | keep the scaling present in the  |
   |                                  | parent object. By default it is  |
   |                                  | set to ``TRUE``, which means     |
   |                                  | that the returned TPMs will be   |
   |                                  | scaled *by million of reads of   |
   |                                  | the selected bins*.              |
   +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
   | ``rescale_copy_number``          | logical. If ``TRUE``, copy       |
   |                                  | numbers with be recalculated     |
   |                                  | using the RecA/RadA coverages in |
   |                                  | the subset. Otherwise, RecA/RadA |
   |                                  | coverages will be taken from the |
   |                                  | parent object. By default it is  |
   |                                  | set to ``TRUE``, which means     |
   |                                  | that the returned copy numbers   |
   |                                  | for each function will represent |
   |                                  | the average copy number of that  |
   |                                  | function *per genome of the      |
   |                                  | selected bins*.                  |
