   .. rubric:: Select ORFs
      :name: subsetORFs

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Create a SQM object containing only the requested ORFs, and the
   contigs and bins that contain them. Internally, all the other subset
   functions in this package end up calling ``subsetORFs`` to do the
   work for them.

   .. rubric:: Usage
      :name: usage

   .. code:: R

      subsetORFs(
        SQM,
        orfs,
        tax_source = "orfs",
        trusted_functions_only = FALSE,
        ignore_unclassified_functions = FALSE,
        rescale_tpm = FALSE,
        rescale_copy_number = FALSE,
        recalculate_bin_stats = TRUE,
        contigs_override = NULL,
        allow_empty = FALSE
      )

   |                                  | recalculated (so that the TPMs   |

   |                                  | set to ``FALSE``, which means    |
   |                                  | that the returned copy numbers   |
   |                                  | for each function will represent |
   |                                  | the average copy number of that  |

   |                                  | based on the contigs present in  |
   |                                  | the subsetted object (default    |

   .. rubric:: Value
      :name: value

   SQM object containing the requested ORFs.

   .. rubric:: A note on contig/bins subsetting
      :name: a-note-on-contigbins-subsetting

   While this function selects the contigs and bins that contain the
   desired orfs, it DOES NOT recalculate contig abundance and statistics
   based on the selected ORFs only. This means that the abundances
   presented in tables such as ``SQM$contig$abund`` will still refer to
   the complete contigs, regardless of whether only a fraction of their
   ORFs are actually present in the returned SQM object. This is also
   true for the statistics presented in ``SQM$contigs$table``. Bin
   statistics may be recalculated if ``rescale_copy_number`` is set to
   ``TRUE``, but recalculation will be based on contigs, not ORFs.

      data(Hadza)
      # Select the 100 most abundant ORFs in our dataset.
      mostAbundantORFnames = names(sort(rowSums(Hadza$orfs$tpm), decreasing=TRUE))[1:100]
      mostAbundantORFs = subsetORFs(Hadza, mostAbundantORFnames)
