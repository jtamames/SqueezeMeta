\usage{
subsetContigs(
  SQM,
  contigs,
  trusted_functions_only = FALSE,
  ignore_unclassified_functions = FALSE,
  rescale_tpm = FALSE,
  rescale_copy_number = FALSE,
  recalculate_bin_stats = TRUE,
  allow_empty = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SQM}{SQM object to be subsetted.}

\item{contigs}{character. Vector of contigs to be selected.}

\item{trusted_functions_only}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, only highly trusted functional annotations (best hit + best average) will be considered when generating aggregated function tables. If \code{FALSE}, best hit annotations will be used (default \code{FALSE}).}

\item{ignore_unclassified_functions}{logical. If \code{FALSE}, ORFs with no functional classification will be aggregated together into an "Unclassified" category. If \code{TRUE}, they will be ignored (default \code{FALSE}).}

\item{rescale_tpm}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, TPMs for KEGGs, COGs, and PFAMs will be recalculated (so that the TPMs in the subset actually add up to 1 million). Otherwise, per-function TPMs will be calculated by aggregating the TPMs of the ORFs annotated with that function, and will thus keep the scaling present in the parent object (default \code{FALSE}).}

\item{rescale_copy_number}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, copy numbers with be recalculated using the RecA/RadA coverages in the subset. Otherwise, RecA/RadA coverages will be taken from the parent object. By default it is set to \code{FALSE}, which means that the returned copy numbers for each function will represent the average copy number of that function per genome in the parent object.}

\item{recalculate_bin_stats}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, bin stats and taxonomy are recalculated based on the contigs present in the subsetted object (default \code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
SQM object containing only the selected contigs.
}
\description{
Create a SQM object containing only the requested contigs, the ORFs contained in them and the bins that contain them.
