\title{Combine several SQM or SQMlite objects}
\usage{
combineSQMlite(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{an arbitrary number of SQM or SQMlite objects}
}
\value{
A SQMlite object
}
\description{
Combine an arbitrary number of SQM or SQMlite objects into a single SQMlite object. This function accepts objects originating from different projects (i.e. different SqueezeMeta runs).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
data(Hadza)
# Load data coming from a different run
other = loadSQMlite("/path/to/other/project/tables") # e.g. if the project was run using sqm_reads
# (We could also use loadSQM to load the data as long as the data comes from a SqueezeMeta run)
combined = combineSQMlite(Hadza, other)
plotTaxonomy(combined, 'family') # Now we can plot together the samples from Hadza and the second project.
